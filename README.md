# three-js-sandbox

A personal sandbox for experimenting with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — a place to explore interactive 3D graphics, creative ideas, and real-time effects using WebGL and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🚀 Current Features

- A spinning 3D cube with custom logo texture on all faces
- Smooth scale-up animation when hovering the mouse over the cube
- Responsive canvas with basic interaction setup

## 🧪 Purpose

This repo is intended as an open-ended playground to:

- Prototype new 3D effects
- Learn and test Three.js concepts
- Try out lighting, shading, postprocessing, and interactivity
- Explore how Three.js elements might integrate into portfolio or production sites (e.g. animated logos, interactive elements)

## 🔮 Ideas for Future Experiments

- Mouse-parallax rotation and motion-based interactions
- Sprite or shader-based glow effects
- 3D particle systems or floating UI elements
- Model loading and animation with GLTF
- Scroll-based camera or scene transitions
- Integration into a React or Next.js site as a component

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- HTML + CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
